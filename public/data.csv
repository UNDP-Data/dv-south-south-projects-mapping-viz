Beginning with 16 member states, FOSS has grown significantly to 108 countries today. This project is a platform that provides technical assistance and capacity building to small states in the Global South, offering access to a range of tools and services, such as policy advice, training, and mentoring on issues related to sustainable development, climate change, and economic growth. To mark the 30th anniversary of FOSS in 2022, Singapore launched the “FOSS for Good” technical assistance package under the Singapore Cooperation Programme (SCP), a platform to extend technical assistance for fellow developing countries. The SCP has hosted close to 150,000 foreign government officials from 180 countries, territories and inter-governmental organisations in its programmes. In the spirit of mutual cooperation to foster collective growth, the “FOSS for Good” package aims to provide a peer-learning platform for government officials from FOSS member states to share experiences and best practices, and adapt the knowledge learnt to their own countries, based on their own national circumstances. The package, which will run from 2022 to 2023, focuses on member states’ vital development priorities such as digital transformation and COVID-19 recovery. To further support solidarity amongst FOSS, Singapore will offer sponsorship to all FOSS states under the package regardless of their development status.A peer-learning platform for government officials from FOSS member states to share experiences and best practices and adapt the knowledge learned to their own countries based on their own national circumstances.
