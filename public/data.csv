17,TRANSFORM ,"https://my.southsouth-galaxy.org/en/solutions/detail/TRANSFORM,www.transformsp.org","TRANSFORM is an innovative learning package on the administration of social protection floors in Africa and the Arab region.The primary objective of TRANSFORM is to build critical thinking and capacities of policymakers and practitioners at national and decentralized levels to improve the design, effectiveness and efficiency of social protection systems. This is achieved through South-South cooperation and peer learning among experts. TRANSFORM was developed in 2016 in the Southern African region under leadership of ILO,UNICEF,UNDP and IPC-IG,with support of Irish Aid and the EU-SPS programme.The capacity building and leadership initiative has seen tremendous development and growth since then. Starting with one introductory course and a small group of expert trainers in Southern Africa, the initiative now hosts four Master Trainer cohorts (English, French, Portuguese and Arabic Speaking), offers up to ten different(on and offline)courses and has been implemented in over twenty countries across the African and Arab region. TRANSFORM Africa and Arab region each have their own multi-agency steering committee, Advisory Group (Africa only) and coordination, while built on the same principles. In the African region, over 120 TRANSFORM applications have been delivered thus far to 2500+ participants. Results show that TRANSFORM has influenced thinking and action on the continent in different ways. TRANSFORM  training applications contributed direclty to institutional mind shifts and changes in policy and programme towards more inclusive, sustainable and efficient systems in implementing countries in conjunction with technical support provided by SP partners. In addition, through its Master Trainer groups as well as supporting agencies,  TRANSFORM has brought together and grown a strong network (movement) of regional SP experts and champions, with growing skills and influence(Government, UN and consultants). TRANSFORM offers its leanring materials as a public good which makes it available for different uses by a wide range of stakehodlers. In several countries, TRANSFORM has been adopted as preferred capacity building tool by national governemnts and in some cases national leanring institutes have adapted the curriculum and trained their own staff in the teaching approach, ensuring a more sustainable and larger scale knowledge transfer (Ghana, Tunisia, Kenya). This initiative will have the potential to support the relevant state and non-state actors in the Arab States in leading change and transformation in their own social protection systems, enable constructive and informed dialogue and support efforts towards social justice. By building a network of social protection practitioners, professionals and (academic) experts from the Arab region and by providing a platform for dialogue, TRANSFORM promotes regional exchange, coalition building and contributes to a culture of social protection in the Arabic language. In particular, the initiative will be able to support countries in addressing ongoing challenges including those concerning the transition from humanitarian to social protection support, coverage of non-nationals and strengthening linkages to the insurance sector, with a focus on efficient and sustainable digital data management and information systems. TRANSFORM is already embedded in national technical assistance projects in several countries in the region(Iraq, Lebanon,OPT,Jordan) and demand has been expressed by among others Tunisia, Egypt,Mauritania and Yemen.
