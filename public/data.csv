By making project information available online or through events, publications and web platforms (including in particular the Global South- South Development Academy web platform, http:// academy.ssc.undp.org, and the ILO Social Protection Platform, www.social-protection.org), more countries are now learning from these experiences and findings. The project was implemented in close collaboration with United Nations resident coordinators and country teams under the auspices of UNDP/UNDG and other United Nations organizations. The direct recipients of the South-South exchanges were representatives from relevant ministries, decentralized government, social partners, social security institutions and other stakeholders involved in social protection from the participating countries. The project did this by supporting the systematic, cross-country transfer of knowledge, skills and expertise in the area of social protection. The following are some examples of how the exchanges proved fruitful. The experience of Thailand in strengthening the health protection system and extending health protection was useful for both the health insurance fund and the strategy to extend into Cambodia and the Lao People's Democratic Republic. The experiences of Brazil, India, Mongolia and others in setting up a coordination mechanism and/or single database of beneficiaries were useful for Cambodia__ social service delivery mechanism also currently being piloted. The experience of India in monitoring and evaluating protocols for social protection schemes proved useful for Cambodia__ new delivery mechanism currently being piloted. The assessment-based national dialogue tool that supports the identification of costed scenarios to extend social protection and facilitate the decision-making process was developed, tested, applied and fine-tuned through South-South exchanges. In Cambodia, national stakeholders learned from countries_ experiences in setting up a coordination mechanism following the single-window service approach (Brazil, India and Mongolia) to facilitate outreach to rural populations. A monitoring and evaluation protocol was developed based on experiences from India, which helped to strengthen the national health insurance system and staff capacity- building. In the Lao People__ Democratic Republic, exchanges were productive in supporting the extension of social health protection through the development of the Social Security Law (2013), national health insurance scheme regulations, pilot scheme technical guidelines (2015), and capacity-building of national stakeholders including the new National Social Security Fund.","LAO,KHM","THA,BRA,IND,MNG","Asia Pacific,LAC,Europe","UNOSSC,ILO,UNDG,UNDP ",,YES,,,2012,2015,"Gender Equality,Agriculture and Food Security,Governance",Social Protection,SDG2,"SDG1,SDG3,SDG8,SDG10,SDG17"

With the technical support of an agricultural engineer at TREE AID, the Beninese farmers learned how to use assisted natural regeneration to improve their trees_ productive capacity. By establishing a system for rotating the branches to ensure stable fruit yield, they were able to increase shea butter production by 3 tonnes in two years, at a rate of 1.5 tonnes per year. The Beninese producers also learned how to naturally control parasitic plants, which are a considerable hindrance to shea production.
